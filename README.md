A Streamlit-based task tracking application that helps you monitor time spent on different tasks and synchronizes data with Google Sheets.

## Features

- Create and manage tasks with case numbers
- Track time spent on tasks with start/stop functionality
- Real-time task timing with accurate session tracking
- Synchronization with Google Sheets
- Persistent storage of task data
- Delete individual tasks or all tasks at once
- Maintains accurate time calculations across sessions

## Time Tracking Details

- **Original Start Time**: When a task is first created
- **Recent Start Time**: Updated each time a task is started
- **Stop Time**: When a task is stopped
- **Total Time**: Accumulates time across all sessions

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up Google Sheets API:
   - Create a project in Google Cloud Console
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
   - Download the credentials and save as `credentials.json` in the project root

3. First run will require Google authorization:
   - Run the application
   - Follow the OAuth flow in your browser
   - Grant necessary permissions
   - The app will save the token for future use
